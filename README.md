This project is a visualization of British Airways customer reviews between 2011 and 2023. The first graph is a line graph is the overall score on a scale from 1-10 over time. The second graph is a bar chart is the overall ratings distribution from 1 to 10. This graph is filterable by travel class. The random review button displays a random review. Finally, there is a wordcloud of the most common words in the review header(with common words such as "The", "And", etc. removed).

The data came from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chaudharyanshul/airline-reviews). I created a year column out of the Datetime column.

To further improve the work I might use ChatGPT to guess the gender of each reviewer based off their first name to analyze differences in reviews by gender.
